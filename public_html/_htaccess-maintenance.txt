# Maintenance Mode Configuration with IP Whitelist
# ===========================================
# This setup keeps the site in maintenance mode for general users,
# while allowing access from specific IP addresses for development.
# It’s useful during migrations or upgrades before Geeklog is fully installed.

# Enable Rewrite Engine
RewriteEngine On

# --- Allowed IP addresses (written in regex) ---
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} ^147\.14\.138\.5$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} ^29\.99\.44\.10$

# → Allow normal access for the above IPs
RewriteRule ^ - [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/\.maintenance

# --- Redirect all other visitors to the maintenance page ---
RewriteRule ^.*$ /.maintenance/index.html [L]
